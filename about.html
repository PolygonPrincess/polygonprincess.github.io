                        <p class="fs-4">Hi! I'm Polygon Princess, but many people call me Poly! I am a non-binary trans woman in my 30s and my pronouns are She/They. As you can see, I create content on Twitch, create music for myself and for others,
                            as well as program! I've spent most of my life in Washington DC metro area (DMV for those who know), but I've been fortunate to travel to various cities throughout the United States and even to Puerto Rico a few times.
                            Aside from creating content and music, I've been building desktop computers for the better part of 10 years and I've taken a pretty length break from my professional career as a software engineer for a variety of reasons.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-4">I cherish my friends and family dearly. Fun fact about my family, I didn't know half of my family until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic! We actually met through an online AncestryDNA test online. You can imagine how
                            shocking that was for all of us involved. My story was featured on Ancestry's page in a video during pride month, and if you'd like to take a look at it here's a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AncestryUS/videos/2644968735674416">link to that video</a>!

                            My content creation journey started on Twitch technicaly started in 2018, but it wasn't until later 2019/early 2020 when I really started my content creation journey.
                            I've went through a variety of games through the years, be it Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, Super Mario Maker, Minecraft, amongst many others. I simply play the things that bring me joy and share that joy with others.
                            Apart from video games, I've done a few streams dabbling in makeup, drag, creating wigs, tier lists of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants who have escaped the matrix (that was fun), and even streamed with my dad!
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-4">Throughout my Twitch journey, I've been fortunate enough to raise money independtly as well as participate and lead group efforts for various charitable causes. As a result, I've been fortunate to meet quite a few lovely
                            people on the way! I am a Team Lead for Team Overture, a stream team of diverse creators looking working to create cool shit. I feel so lucky to be give the opportunity to collaborate with talented and passionate
                            creators through Overture. In addition, I've just recently joined the Twitch Pride Guild!

                        <p class="fs-4">My musical journey begins all the way in fifth grade (not clickbait)! I played trumpet for a year and in high school I took a piano class. Additionally, in high school is when I discovered FL Studio, the digital audio workstation
                            I use to this day! I've always been interested in music, be it as a listener or creator. Music to me is a universal language and is a very versatile art form. I've been casually producing since 2009, although 2022 onward I've been slowly
                            pushing myself to venture out and take it more seriously!
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-4">On the homepage you'll find a playlist of snippets and things I've uploaded to SoundCloud over the years. However, that's not everything! I don't just create music for myself, but for others as well, be it as a producer, songwriter, 
                            mixer or providing vocals! I've even got Spotify credits to my name via <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/62WOHawJeSLAZUQMXwSd9a">Sum Ting Wong's UNI (You & I)</a>. Additionally, I am working on a collaborative EP with producer and friend
